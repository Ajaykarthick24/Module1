# Datatypes-Character Literal in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that prints the characters `'T'` and `'a'` using character literals.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Print the character `'T'`.
2. Print the character `'a'`.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
a='T' 
b='a' 
print(a) 
print(b)
## Output

## Result
Thus the program which prints the characters 'T' and 'a' using character literals is done successfully.
